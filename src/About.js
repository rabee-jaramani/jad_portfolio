                        software creation. By applying these engineering principles to every stage
                         of the development process, from requirements analysis to the software process,
                          they can create customized systems for individual clients. Just as a civil

                          software engineer will also begin with a thorough study of requirements
                           and work through the development process in a systematic way.
